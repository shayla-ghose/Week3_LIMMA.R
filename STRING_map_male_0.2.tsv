1	RPS4Y1	9606.ENSP00000250784	RPS4Y1	Ribosomal protein S4 Y-linked 1; Belongs to the eukaryotic ribosomal protein eS4 family.
2	DDX3Y	9606.ENSP00000353284	DDX3Y	ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX3Y; Probable ATP-dependent RNA helicase. During immune response, may enhance IFNB1 expression via IRF3/IRF7 pathway (By similarity). Belongs to the DEAD box helicase family. DDX3/DED1 subfamily.
3	PRKY	9606.ENSP00000498737	PRKY	Putative serine/threonine-protein kinase PRKY; Protein kinase Y-linked; Belongs to the protein kinase superfamily. AGC Ser/Thr protein kinase family. cAMP subfamily.
4	AIM2	9606.ENSP00000357112	AIM2	Interferon-inducible protein AIM2; Involved in innate immune response by recognizing cytosolic double-stranded DNA and inducing caspase-1-activating inflammasome formation in macrophages. Upon binding to DNA is thought to undergo oligomerization and to associate with PYCARD initiating the recruitment of caspase-1 precusrsor and processing of interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-18. Detects cytosolic dsDNA of viral and bacterial origin in a non-sequence-specific manner. Can also trigger PYCARD-dependent, caspase-1-independent cell death that involves caspase-8 (By similarity). Tumor suppr [...] 
5	KDM5D	9606.ENSP00000322408	KDM5D	Lysine-specific demethylase 5D; Histone demethylase that specifically demethylates 'Lys-4' of histone H3, thereby playing a central role in histone code. Does not demethylate histone H3 'Lys-9', H3 'Lys-27', H3 'Lys-36', H3 'Lys-79' or H4 'Lys-20'. Demethylates trimethylated and dimethylated but not monomethylated H3 'Lys-4'. May play a role in spermatogenesis. Involved in transcriptional repression of diverse metastasis-associated genes; in this function seems to cooperate with ZMYND8. Suppresses prostate cancer cell invasion. Regulates androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional activity  [...] 
6	UTY	9606.ENSP00000442047	UTY	Histone demethylase UTY; Male-specific histone demethylase that catalyzes trimethylated 'Lys-27' (H3K27me3) demethylation in histone H3. Has relatively low lysine demethylase activity. Belongs to the UTX family.
8	XIST	9606.ENSP00000491215	HNRNPU	Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U; DNA- and RNA-binding protein involved in several cellular processes such as nuclear chromatin organization, telomere-length regulation, transcription, mRNA alternative splicing and stability, Xist-mediated transcriptional silencing and mitotic cell progression. Plays a role in the regulation of interphase large-scale gene-rich chromatin organization through chromatin-associated RNAs (caRNAs) in a transcription-dependent manner, and thereby maintains genomic stability. Required for the localization of the long non-coding Xist RNA on the inactiv [...]
